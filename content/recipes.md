# Summer Veggie Pasta

I made this dish while at SouthWinds Farm due to an excess of carrots and summer squash. It may seem healthy, but regrettably it is not.

### Ingredients

- 8oz dried pasta
- 1 medium summer squash, chopped into rounds
- 2 medium carrots, chopped into rounds
- 1 italian sausage
- 4 tbsp salted butter
- 2 garlic cloves, minced
- 1/2 cup crumbled feta cheese
- black pepper
- italian seasoning

### Procedure

1. Cook the pasta according to package directions while performing the rest of the steps.
2. Brown the sausage over medium heat in a non-stick pan, while crumbling into bite-sized pieces.
3. Set aside the sausage, leaving the grease in the pan. Add the butter to this grease.
4. Add the carrots to the greasy pan, and saute for ~5 minutes.
5. Add the summer squash and garlic to the pan, continue sauteing for ~8 minutes, or until the squash is softened. Stir in a generous pinch of black pepper and italian seasoning.
6. Combine with the pasta, then add back the sausage along with the feta cheese.
7. Serve hot.

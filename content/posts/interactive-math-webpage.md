I've always been interested in visual descriptions of math, and I think interactive displays are a useful educative tool for developing intuition. Making a website to visually display the terms of the complex exponential function (as a Maclaurin series) has been on the to-do list for a while. Problem is, I am not a web developer, and have never worked with web technologies.

I had a few days open so I decided to dig into the details and make this webpage. I think my inexperience with JS, HTML, and CSS show through but overall I am happy with the result. If I have any more ideas for these sorts of webpages I might continue them as a series in the future.

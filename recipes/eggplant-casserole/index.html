Ingredients 3 Japanese eggplant, cut into rounds (If using American eggplant, salt and drain them first to remove bitterness) 3 small slicing tomatoes 1 small red onion, finely chopped 3/4 cup chopped cooked chicken (I used 2 thighs) 1 jalapeño, minced 2 garlic cloves, minced 1 cup grated colby jack cheese, or to taste 2 tsps extra virgin olive oil 1/2 tsp salt Procedure Blanch the tomatoes in a small saucepan for a couple minutes to loosen the skins, then drain and let cool. In the emptied saucepan, heat the olive oil and then add the garlic, jalapeño, onions. Saute on medium heat. While the other ingredients are cooking, peel and dice the tomatoes. Once the onions are translucent, add the tomatoes and salt. Simmer this on low for about 30-45 minutes or until the tomatoes are mostly disintegrated and the sauce has thickened up. During this period preheat the oven to 400 degrees Fahrenheit. After the sauce is ready, the casserole can be assembled. In a 8"x8" baking dish, add a layer of half the eggplant, then half the chicken, and likewise half the sauce. Repeat this for 3 more layers. Top the dish with the grated cheese, for me this ended up being about 1" thick. Bake the casserole for 25 minutes or until the cheese starts to brown. Cool for 5 minutes then serve.

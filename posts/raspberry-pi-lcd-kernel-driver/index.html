Thankfully, there was great information to be found online, in places such as the <a href=https://lwn.net/Kernel/LDD3/>Linux Device Drivers book</a> and the <a href=https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2012/02/BCM2835-ARM-Peripherals.pdf>Broadcom peripherals datasheet</a>. There were a few topics that were not well documented, such as the creation of /dev entries and which of the several delay functions to use for a given scenario, but after some searching I found answers to these as well. As for the driver itself, it has a fairly standard topology. On module initialization, a virtual memory page for the GPIO registers is mapped, and startup commands are sent to the screen. Since Raspbian supports it, udev is utilized to create the /dev entry for the character device. Reads simply return a static message, and writes are sent over the bus to the screen one nibble at a time. While the operations in this driver are basic, I think it was a good starting place for kernel-side development. I hope to work on a network or block device driver, and utilize more advanced features in the future. The code for this driver is <a href=https://github.com/DonDrews/linux_driver_tests>here</a>. Included in the repository is a small script to write to the screen from stdin.</p></div></div><div class=pagination><div class=pagination__title><span class=pagination__title-h></span><hr></div><div class=pagination__buttons><span class="button previous"><a href=https://dondrews.github.io/posts/usb-controller-with-stm32/><span class=button__icon>←</span>
